# sprossbox-sponsormap
The project "Sprossbox - Dein Schulgarten f√ºrs Fensterbrett" is a non-profit attempt to teach kids about the value of primary foods and its growth processes. This is a map showing contributors to our crowdfunding campaign.

At the moment this is only a slightly modified version of [this ui-leaflet example](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-leaflet/examples/0000-viewer.html#/markers/clustering-without-overlays-example).
